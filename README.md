# TO-DO

## Overview

To-Do is a Django-based web application that allows users to create and
manage events. Users can also add events from Ticketmaster to their cart, view event details, and manage their cart
items. The application integrates with the Ticketmaster API to fetch event data and display it alongside user-created
events.
